# WebAssembly Elementary Cellular Automaton

A small elementary cellular automaton simulator I built with Rust and WebAssembly. I wanted an introductory project to Rust, and this seemed a
bit more fun and useful than a CLI to-do app. Using Rust makes it quite a 
bit faster than what you'd otherwise get.
